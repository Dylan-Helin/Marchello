# Marchello
Marchello is a robot which repeats everything is said to it like a parrot but never forgets anything like a elephant.
Marchello is developped using Spring boot and Vue.js.

I decided to use Spring Boot and Vue.js because these are technologies I already used with langages I know and it allow me to do this work pretty quickly.
I have also chosen these technologies in order to follow the conception model MVC easily.

You can talk with Marchello by typing in the text area but he is pretty annoying as he always responds with the same sentence as you,
except if you say "Comment est votre blanquette ?", after saying that, maybe saying "On me dit le plus grand bien des harengs pomme-à-l’huile" will make him say something new.

You can also see what Marchello remembers by clicking "Souvenirs de Marchello", here everything Roberto or Marchello says will be registered.
