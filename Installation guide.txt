This project is made with Spring Boot and Vue.js

I tried to use Docker but it didn't work properly on my device,
Windows didn't bring allow me to put Marchello on Docker or to place my database (using MySQL) where I want.

It didn't allow me to retrieve my database either, this why I can't bring it in the GitHub.

To run this project, first you must open a MySQL at port 3307 (on your computer or on docker).
Then run the Spring boot Marchello app by running the project on your favorite IDE or by lauching the jar located in the "marchello/target" folder.
Once the spring boot app is running, you can start the vue.js app by typing "npm run serve" in a terminal launched in the "marchello-front" folder.
You may need to remove "package-lock.json" and "node_modules" then do "npm install" before "npm run serve" in order to run Marchello properly.

If you are using docker : (this is theorical and couldn't be tested)

- create a network :
docker network create marchello-net

- create your database :
docker run -p 3307:3307 --net marchello-net --name mysqldb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=db_marchello -v "path to your database folder":/var/lib/mysql mysql

- create Marchello :
(in the marchello folder)
docker build -t marchello
docker run -p 5000:5000 --net marchello-net --name marchello -e MYSQL_HOST=mysqldb marchello

- create Marchello's Front :
(in the marchello-front folder)
docker build -t marchello-front
docker run -p 8081:8081 --net marchello-net --name marchello-front marchello-front

By doing so, Marchello should run as intended
